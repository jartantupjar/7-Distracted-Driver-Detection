Troubleshooting:
	1. Ran out of memory? 
		Solution: Buy more RAM

		Solution: open cmd/anaconda prompt then input this line : 	jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=100000000
	3. Why did I take so long -(3 months)
		my experience... my hardware...
	4. Why does the solution suck?
		Im sorry i tried so hard...
	5. Why is this the solution the best thing I have ever seen?
